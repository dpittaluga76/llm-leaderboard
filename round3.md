# llm-leaderboard  ( 2025 - Round 3 - January 27th thru 2nd February)
Personal customized LLM Leaderboard without contamination! (Weekly Updates)

In this round instead of challenges we will schedule chess matches, however since we have 5 LLM's the one that gets a BYE must have to pass the following test: Creativity Level 0<br>
Using https://wheelofnames.com/ to generate the pairings...
1st Match.. PLAYER 1 with white is: o1-mini.
1st Match.., PLAYER 2 with black is: 4o.
2nd Match.. PLAYER 1 with white is: DeepSeek R1.
2nd Match.., PLAYER 2 with black is: GPT-4.

Rules of the chess matches, no illegal moves are allowed, the first to make a illegal move looses.

Thus the creativity challenge gets assigned to o1.

| Date       | Challenge                             | o1                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 2025-01-28 | Creativity Level 0                    |   --                  |


After the 3rd round we had a chat with each LLM again:<br>
    [4o]()<br>
    [o1-mini]()<br>
    [o1]()<br>
    [GPT-4]()<br>
    [DeepSeek R1]()<br>

And the time to start voting starts!:<br><br>

4o casted votes:  -- holds off on "Negative Boost".<br>
GPT-4 casted votes: -- has 2 unused cards.<br>
o1 casted votes:  -- holds off "Salvation" card. <br>
o1-mini casted votes: --no cards left.<br><br>
DeepSeek R1 (aka "Cerebro") casted votes: -- no cards left.  <br><br>

Results:<br>
    4o: 
    o1: 
    GPT-4: 
    o1-mini: 
    DeepSeek R1:
